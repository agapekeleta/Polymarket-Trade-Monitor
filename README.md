# Polymarket-Trade-Monitor
This Python script monitors new trades on Polymarket and evaluates the wallets involved in those trades based on their trading history, profitability, and win rate. The script sends notifications to a Discord webhook if a wallet meets the predefined criteria, indicating it as a potentially good wallet.
